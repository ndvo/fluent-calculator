# Fluent calculator

A Python3 module implementing a Fluent Syntax calculator

This small module was built as an exercise for a job interview.

It is a calculator that uses the "fluent syntax" as instructed in the exercise.

## Syntax

Both numbers and opperations are attributes of the calculator. To use it, chain them together.

Here are some examples:

- one.plus.one # 2
- two.times.five # 10



## Usage:


<pre><code>
import kata


- kata.Cal.new.2.plus.2 # returns 4
- kata.Cal.new.3.times.3 # returns 9

You may omit the new in the chain if your chain is made of an operand, an operation and an operator.
