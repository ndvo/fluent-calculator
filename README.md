# Fluent calculator

This small application was built as an exercise for a job interview.

It is a calculator that uses the "fluent syntax" as instructed in the exercise.

## Syntax

Both numbers and opperations are attributes of the calculator. To use it, chain them together.

Here are some examples:

- one.plus.one // 2
- two.times.five // ten
